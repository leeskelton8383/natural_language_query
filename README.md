# Natural Language Query Experiments

This repository contains a collection of small projects exploring different approaches to Natural Language Query (NLQ).

Each folder represents a standalone experiment using different datasets, prompting strategies, and execution patterns (e.g., SQL, pandas).

The goal is not a single unified framework, but to document learning, tradeoffs, and practical patterns when building NLQ systems with LLMs.
